## vi-xournalpp (Collaborator)

A Lua extension for Xournal++ that implements vi-style modal keybindings through
Xournal++'s Lua API.

Repo: [vi-xournalpp](https://github.com/youssefadly237/vi-xournalpp).

## taskbeep

Since I lose track of time A LOT, I made a tiny CLI timer for myself.
It beeps to remind me that I am alive, and it integrates very well with waybar.

Repo: [taskbeep](https://github.com/youssefadly237/taskbeep)

## Calz

Rust library for multi-calendar conversions. Inspired by the book Calendrical
Calculations by Dershowitz & Reingold. It aims to be a scientific reference for
calendar arithmetic and conversions.
