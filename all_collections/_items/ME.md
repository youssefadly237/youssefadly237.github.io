title: About Me!
---

Hi! I'm Youssef Adly, a medical student, developer, and creator. I mean, what is life without learning, creating, and pressing that red button just to see what it does? ðŸ™„

## Who Am I?

I'm currently a medical student at Minia National University (MNU), trying to balance my studies with my passion for tech, coding, and creativity. When I'm not buried in textbooks (which is most of the time), I'm probably diving into something completely new and random. But in general, the most frequent things I do:

- **Coding**: Seeing something that makes me say "Woooooow, gotta try that!"
- **Playing Brawl Stars**: the Janitor
- **Scrolling through my phone**: (Let's be honest, we all do it!)
- **Playing Lute**: A peaceful hobby I enjoy.
- **Making Tea**: dear Tea, please fix my life

## Work & Expertise

Iâ€™ve worked on various small projects, and Iâ€™m always exploring new challenges. Iâ€™ll update this section when I do something truly great! ðŸš€

## My Interests

- **Science**: Iâ€™ve always been curious, and I love how science helps solve mysteries and answer questions.
- **Medicine**: Exploring a special piece of the complex puzzle of lifeâ€”it's the most beautiful one crafted by God that I've ever seen.
- **Coding and Development**: Building my own apps, websites, and tools to simplify my life. Iâ€™ve got some exciting projects coming soon (fingers crossed that "soon" really is soon!).
- **Creative Pursuits**: Playing music, designing, and drawing (I'm not a professional artist, but I enjoy expressing myself through sketches and designs).
