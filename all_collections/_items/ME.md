title: About Me!
---

Hi! I'm J. Adly (also Youssef or Joseph, depending on context).
Medical student by day, hobbyist dev by night.
I operate on the fact that life is best spent learning, building, and pushing that red button 🙄

## What Keeps Me Going

- **Building Things**: whether creating or breaking (mostly breaking), I like to
  make stuff, not just code anything (I think this is who I am)
- **Coding**: my primary building material
- **Curiosity**: my parents can tell you how annoying I was with "how" and "why"
  growing up (I still do)
- **Medicine**: yeah I'm a doctor, how awesome 🫠
- **Art & Music**: listening, sketching, and playing a bit of Lute and Piano
- **Tea**: dear Tea, please fix my life 🍵
- **Playing Brawl Stars**: the Janitor
