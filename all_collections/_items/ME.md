title: About Me!
---

Hi! I'm J. Adly (also Youssef or Joseph, depending on context)
I'm a medical student, hobbyist dev. I mean, what is life without learning,
creating, and pressing that red button just to see what it does? 🙄

## Who Am I?

I'm currently a medical student at Minia National University (MNU), trying to
balance my studies with my passion for computer science, and creativity.
When I'm not buried in textbooks (which is most of the time), I'm probably diving
into something completely new and random. But in general, the most frequent
things I do:

- **Coding**: Seeing something that makes me say "Woooooow, gotta try that!"
- **Playing Brawl Stars**: the Janitor
- **Scrolling through my phone**: (Let's be honest, we all do it!)
- **Playing Lute**: A peaceful hobby I enjoy.
- **Making Tea**: dear Tea, please fix my life

## My Interests

  just science for the sake of science.
- **Medicine**: yeah I am doctor, how awesome 🫠.
- **Coding and Development**: Building my own apps, websites, and tools to
  simplify my life.
- **Creative Pursuits**: Playing music, designing, and drawing (I'm not a
  professional artist, but I enjoy expressing myself through sketches and designs).
